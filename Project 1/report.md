Creating a data warehouse involves several steps from understanding the data to building the architecture that supports efficient query processing. Let's walk through these steps using the files you've uploaded:

### Step 1: Understanding the Data
First, we'll explore the datasets you've uploaded to understand the structure and content of each. This step is crucial as it informs how we might link the data and what kind of queries it can support.

#### Datasets Overview
1. **Economic Data**: Likely contains economic indicators like GDP, inflation rates, etc. Columns include Time, Country Name, Country Code, and various economic indicators like GDP, infant mortality rate, and internet security.
2. **Global Population**: Population statistics by country or region. Columns span multiple years showing population data for various countries.
3. **Life Expectancy**: Information on life expectancy per country or region. Data includes life expectancy rates per country   across several years.
4. **Countries by Continent**: Mapping countries to their respective continents. A simple mapping of countries to their respective continents.
5. **Mental Illness**: Data regarding mental health statistics by country or region. Statistics related to mental health issues per country across different years.
6. **Olympic Hosts**: Information on which countries hosted the Olympics and when. Information about Olympic games, including location, name, season, and year.
7. **Olympic Medals**: Data on Olympic medals won by country.  Detailed data on Olympic medals, including discipline, event, medal type, participant details, and country information.

### Step 2: Data Profiling and Cleaning
Next, we'll load each dataset and perform basic profiling to identify issues like missing values, data types, and potential primary keys.

Here are some common cleaning steps we might consider for each dataset:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Determine how to handle rows or columns with a lot of missing dataâ€”whether to fill them, remove them, or keep them as is.
2. **Standardizing Formats**: Ensure that all data, especially categorical and date data, follow consistent formats across datasets.
3. **Resolving Inconsistencies**: Look for and correct any discrepancies in naming conventions or data types, especially for fields that will serve as keys in our warehouse, like country names or codes.
4. **Data Type Conversions**: Convert columns to the most appropriate data types (e.g., converting text to numeric where applicable).

1. **Economic Data**: 


### Step 3: Data Modeling
Based on the understanding from the first two steps, we'll decide on a data model for the warehouse. We can use a star schema, with fact and dimension tables:

- **Fact Tables**: Central tables (like Olympic Medals or Economic Indicators).
- **Dimension Tables**: Supporting tables that add context (like Countries, Time, and Demographics).

### Step 4: Data Integration
We will define the relationships between tables and possibly combine some datasets based on common attributes (like country names or codes).

### Step 5: Building the Warehouse
After modeling, we'll use a database system to create the schema, upload, and index the data for efficient queries.

### Step 6: Testing with Sample Queries
To ensure the warehouse meets needs, we will write and execute sample queries based on potential business questions.

Let's start with Step 1: Loading and exploring each dataset to see what kind of information each contains. I'll load each dataset, and we'll review their content briefly.

It looks like there was an issue with reading the "Global Population" CSV file due to encoding problems. This is a common issue when dealing with text data from various sources, and it can often be resolved by specifying the correct file encoding.

I'll attempt to load this file again using a different encoding setting that might be more appropriate. Let's try loading it with 'ISO-8859-1' encoding, which is often used for data that includes special characters. If this doesn't work, we can try other encodings as well.

We've successfully loaded the "Global Population" dataset using the 'ISO-8859-1' encoding. Now, let's proceed with displaying a brief summary of each dataset to understand their structure and content. I'll present the first few rows of each dataset, which should give us a good overview of the types of data and the columns each contains. This is essential for designing our data warehouse.

It seems there was an oversight in loading some datasets after encountering the encoding error. Let's ensure all datasets are loaded correctly. I'll reload the remaining datasets and then present their summaries again.

It seems I attempted to access datasets that might not have been loaded correctly earlier, causing these errors. Let me ensure all datasets are properly loaded and then provide a summary of each. I'll handle the loading process for all datasets now to avoid any further issues.

All datasets are now successfully loaded and we have a preview of each. Here's a summary of the first few rows for each dataset to help us understand their structure and content:



With these datasets understood, the next step is to clean and prepare the data for integration into a data warehouse. This involves:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting any inaccuracies, and standardizing formats.
2. **Schema Design**: Deciding on a suitable schema to organize these datasets efficiently.
3. **Integration**: Combining related data from different datasets based on common attributes like country names or years.
