Let's repeat the process to separate the newly uploaded `mental-illness.csv` file into two distinct files: one for country data and another for region data. I'll start by examining the file to confirm its structure and to see how the entries are differentiated between countries and regions. Then, I'll proceed with filtering and saving the respective datasets.

I'll now load and preview the contents of `mental-illness.csv` to understand its format and columns.

The `mental-illness.csv` file contains the following columns:

- **Entity**: Name of the country or region.
- **Code**: The international standard code for the country; some are missing, indicating regions.
- **Year**: Year of the data.
- Several columns related to **DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years)** for different mental health disorders, all age-standardized and for both sexes.

### Approach to Separate Data into Country and Region Files

Given this structure, similar to the previous file, entries without a 'Code' will be considered regions, and those with a 'Code' will be considered countries.

#### Steps:
1. **Countries CSV**: This file will contain entries with country codes. It will retain the original country code.
2. **Regions CSV**: This file will contain entries that originally did not have a country code. These entries will be identified as regions, and the 'Code' column will be dropped.

I'll proceed to filter the data based on the presence of the 'Code' column and save them into two CSV files. Let's do this now.

The data from `mental-illness.csv` has been successfully separated into two CSV files:

1. **Countries CSV**: This file includes entries with country codes. You can download it [here](sandbox:/mnt/data/mental-illness-countries.csv).
2. **Regions CSV**: This file consists of entries originally without a country code, and the 'Code' column has been removed. You can download it [here](sandbox:/mnt/data/mental-illness-regions.csv).

These files are now prepared for any specific analysis or further processing you wish to conduct on country and region data separately. If you need more assistance or have other tasks in mind, feel free to ask!
